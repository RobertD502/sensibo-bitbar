# Sensibo Bitbar Plugin

### This plugin provides a quick access to your [Sensibo](https://sensibo.com/) Pods. The plugin requires [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) and obviously, [Bitbar](https://getbitbar.com/).

An API key is required in order for this plugin to function. Your API key can be set using the **API_KEY** variable inside the plugin and you're good to go.

And because i know that an image is worth a thousand words, here's how it looks in your menubar:

The plugin automatically lists all your available PODS with an option turn it on and off.

The data currently shown:

 - current temperature
 - humidity
 - swing
 - fan level
